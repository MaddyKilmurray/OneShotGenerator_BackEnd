#### All the fun of a Dungeons & Dragons game, without the heavy time commitment.

Created in 1972, Dungeons & Dragons is an adventure role-playing game which has captured the imaginations of people all of the world. The premise is simple: A group of friends tell a story together, guiding your heroes through quests for treasure, battles with deadly foes, daring rescues, courtly intrigue, and much more.

It been mentioned in movies and TV, been the start of many podcasts, and a countless amount of games amongst friends.

Many people struggle to play due to the heavy time commitment. A campaign can last anything from weeks to years! Why not play a one-shot instead?

Designed to be a short version of a standard D&D campaign, a one shot is designed to be played in a few hours, an evening, or at most a day. Stories are short and easy to resolve, and creating a character is fun and quirky.

#### Why Should You Use The D&D One-Shot Generator?

Part of the magic of a one-shot is the amount of time saved. The last thing a user would want to do is spend longer creating a character than they would playing it!

The D&D One-Shot Generator allows a player to randomly generate a character, assign them to a party and to print the details to a PDF file. A Games Master can keep a track of their players' characters with the party ID, generate a new party ID and generate their own characters as well.

The Generator is simple, reliable and fun.
